## Key Insights:

**Close Range (1-4m)**: The 100-400mm + 1.4x TC provides the highest magnification, followed by 100-400mm alone

**Medium Range (5-10m)**: 600mm PF + 1.4x TC takes the lead, providing the best magnification for wildlife photography

**Long Range (15-20m)**: 600mm PF configurations maintain clear advantages for distant subjects

**70-200mm Performance**: Best suited for closer subjects; significantly outperformed by longer focal lengths at distance
